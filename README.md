Public website for datasets from the Clouds and Precipitation group.

---

This repository contains the source config and markdown files that are used to generate the website using the static-site generator `zola`.

With [zola installed](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/), the website can be previewed by running `zola serve` in the project root.

When pushing changes on the main branch to GitHub, a "GitHub Actions Workflow" will run to generate and publish the website using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).
