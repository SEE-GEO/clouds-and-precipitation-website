## Description
The Chalmers Cloud Ice Climatology (CCIC) is a novel, deep-learning-based climate record of ice-particle concentrations in the atmosphere. CCIC results are available at high spatial and temporal resolution (0.07° / 3 h from 1983, 0.036° / 30 min from 2000) and thus ideally suited for evaluating high-resolution weather and climate models or studying individual weather systems.
