# Description
The Chalmers Hydrometeor Inversion Product from the Arctic Weather Satellite (CHIP-AWS) provides
estimates of ice hydrometeor masses in the atmosphere across the globe within the +/-60Â° latitude region.
The retrieval methodology is based on the work described in [May et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-5957-2024).

This dataset represents a [level 2](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/earth-observation-data-basics/data-processing-levels) processing of the Arctic Weather Satellite (AWS) level 1B instrument data, as [provided by EUMETSAT](https://data.eumetsat.int/product/EO:EUM:DAT:0905). This processing level produces single-footprint retrievals with relatively high resolution (~10 km in nadir) for this type of instrument.

The following quantities are retrieved:
| Variable | Unit | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Frozen Water Path (FWP) | \\( \mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^2 \\) | Mass of ice hydrometeors in a vertical column through the atmosphere. |
| \\(D_m\\) | \\( \\mathrm{m} \\) | Mass-weighted mean volume equivalent diameter of ice hydrometeors inside the column. |
| \\(Z_m\\) | \\( \\mathrm{m} \\) | Mass-weighted mean altitude of ice hydrometeors inside the column. |

Besides best estimates of the quantities, the uncertainty is described providing quantities of the retrieval knowledge for each property.


Currently, only a preview subset of a few days is publicly available. We plan to continuously process and publish more soon.
