## Abstract

Traditional gradient descent methods often struggle with complex optimization landscapes common in modern machine learning applications. This paper introduces a novel family of adaptive gradient descent algorithms that incorporate momentum-based corrections and dynamic learning rate scheduling to achieve superior convergence properties.

## Key Contributions

1. **Adaptive Momentum Correction**: We develop a new momentum term that adapts based on the local curvature of the loss landscape.

2. **Dynamic Learning Rate Scheduling**: Our method automatically adjusts learning rates based on convergence patterns, eliminating the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.

3. **Theoretical Analysis**: We provide convergence guarantees for our algorithms under both convex and non-convex settings.

4. **Empirical Validation**: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate 15-30% faster convergence compared to existing methods.

## Methodology

Our approach builds upon the classical momentum-based gradient descent but introduces several key innovations:

- **Curvature-aware momentum**: The momentum coefficient is dynamically adjusted based on estimates of the Hessian eigenvalues
- **Adaptive step size**: Learning rates are modified in real-time using a novel feedback mechanism
- **Regularization integration**: Built-in regularization terms that prevent overfitting without additional computational overhead

## Results

We evaluated our algorithms on multiple benchmark tasks:

- **Image Classification**: 23% faster convergence on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
- **Natural Language Processing**: 18% improvement in training time for transformer models
- **Reinforcement Learning**: 31% reduction in sample complexity for policy gradient methods

## Implications

This work opens new avenues for optimization research and provides practical tools for accelerating machine learning training across diverse applications. The adaptive nature of our algorithms makes them particularly suitable for large-scale distributed training scenarios.
